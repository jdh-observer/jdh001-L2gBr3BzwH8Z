The Town an Regional
Planning Act, 1934, is a dry
document of seventy-eight
sections and two schedules. But,
if between its matter-of-fact lines
is read the story of twenty-five
years of public-spirited effort on the
part of a minority group and of
the far-seeing and enlightened action
of the Government which made it
law, it becomes something more
than a dry-as-dust act of Parliament.
A quarter of a century ago the
Housing and Town Planning
Association was formed with the
principal object of educating public
opinion. The small measure of its
success in this direction may be
judged from the fact, that, when
at the end of last year town planning
legislation passed on to the Statute
Book, very few people took any
notice whatever. If ever there was
a case of legislating ahead of public
opinion here was one. Since then,
however, a slight public interest has
become apparent and it is good to
see that local bodies are now alive
to the question and are publishing
notices of intention to make townplanning
schemes.
The Housing and Town Planning
Association gave way to the Civics
Institute of Ireland, a body with
similar aims but more particularly
concerned with the development of
practical citizenship. The Civics
Institute organised, in 1914, a Civic
Exhibition and prepared a comprehensive
programme of public
service. The European War intervened
and until the end of 1922
only the nucleus of the organisation
was kept in being. During this
period Professor Abercrombie's prize-winning
design in the Town Planning
Competition was published under
the title "Dublin of the Future."
In 1922 the Institute prepared and
published a very detailed Survey
of Dublin. A Town Planning Exhibition
was held during the Dublin
Civic Week of 1927. To this the
Civics Institute gave valuable assistance.
It also does valuable work
in the provision and care of children's
play-centres.
The architects of Ireland were
always closely associated with the
work of the Housing and Town
Planning Association and of the
Civics Institute. Many years ago
their representative body, the Royal
Institute of the Architects of Ireland,
prepared a draft Town Planning
Bill. This, in 1929, was handed to
the Civics Institute to be further
considered and brought up to date.
As a result, in the same year, the
Town Planning and Rural Amenities
Bill was introduced to the Senate by
Senator Johnson. It was supported
by Senators Connolly, Brown,
O'Hanlon, O'Farrell and Milroy.
It passed the Senate and went to
the Dail, where it was shelved on
the promise that the Government
would bring in a measure of its own.
Nothing further was done until 1933,
when the present Government introduced
the Town and Regional
Planning Bill, which passed into
law the following year.
The Town and Regional Planning
Act, 1934, brings Ireland into line
with the more progressive of other
countries. Town Planning legislation
in England dates from 1909.
It was then too late to remedy
the chaos created by the muddled
building of the previous century.
It has, however, proved a useful
guide for subsequent development
and has several times been revised
in the light of experience. Some
of the advantages of this experience
have fallen on Ireland and have had
the effect of making our legislation
better than theirs. One important
difference between Irish and English
town planning legislation is that,
in Ireland, if a man repeatedly
contravenes a special prohibition he
can be sent to gaol.
What is Town Planning?
Town Planning legislation is
of recent growth, but town
planning itself is almost as old as
the world. There is a workman's
village at Kahun in Egypt, built
during the third millennium before
Christ, which is an example of
carefully planned accommodation
for the labourers and managers
engaged upon building a neighbouring
pyramid. The ancient Greek
town of Priene is an object-lesson
in the folly of regarding town
planning merely as an arrangement
of streets according to a paper
pattern. Here, a rectangular plan
was applied to a site so hilly that
most of the streets become staircases.
The hard grid plan of New
York is equally unwise in that it
does not acknowledge the undulation
of the coastline. But these examples
convey but a small idea of the scope
of the subject as it is understood
to-day.
Town planning is the art of
shaping and guiding the physical
growth of towns and of rural communities
in harmony with social
and economic needs. It is much
more than street planning and also
covers a wider field than is indicated
by the contents of statutory town
planning schemes. One might
assume that "town planning" meant
the planning of a town de novo, as
was done at Canberra or New Delhi.
But the term is usually applied to
the control and orderly development
of existing towns and villages,
of the country about them and of
the communications between them.
A knowledge of the origin,
principles and purposes of town
planning is necessary if citizens of
Saorstat Eireann are to become
fully aware of their responsibilities
in this important matter. The work
of the Housing and Town Planning
Association, of the Civics Institute,
of the Royal Institute of the Architects
of Ireland and of the Government
which made the Town and
Regional Planning Act, 1934, will
have but limited success if the
individual citizen fails to play his
part. If he remembers that town
planning is not some new-fangled
idea, but has existed in some form
or other since the beginning of
civilisation, he will treat it with
greater respect. If, too, he realises
that it affects his own country,
his own town, his own person he
should require little persuasion to
pursue the subject further.
The Provisions of the Act.
As a responsible citizen he should
O'Connell Bridge that was
have some idea of the provisions of
his Town Planning Act. He will
hardly have time to read its seventy-eight
sections and it is doubtful if
he would find them very amusing
even if he did. They are mainly
concerned with the procedure to be
adopted by those bodies, such as
county councils, borough councils,
and boards of public health, who
are empowered to carry town planning
schemes into effect. They
cover such matters as planning
authorities and areas, the preparation
and contents of planning
schemes and methods of dealing
with the contravention of planning
schemes. But perhaps the most interesting
portions of the Act are the
schedules, which indicate its scope.
The schedules deal with the construction
of roads, regulations in
regard to the size, character, height,
spacing and frontage-lines of buildings
the objects which may be
affixed to structures and the purposes
for which structures may be
used. There may also be regulations
controlling the design, colour and
materials of buildings. In the
schedule dealing with amenities -
amenities being those features which
recognise that man has a soul- 
are to be found clauses on the
reservation of land for public parks
and recreation grounds and the protection
of things of natural beauty.
The Act will also help to protect
objects of artistic, archaeological and
historical interest, as well as shrubs,
trees and flowers. An important
section is that prohibiting, restricting
or controlling advertisements,
whether they be on the ground, on
any structure or temporary erection,
or any vehicle, boat or other movable
object. And advertisements in
the air have not been forgotten.
Not the least important sections
of the Act are those dealing with
Public Services, Transport and
Communication. It will be seen,
therefore, that the Town and
Regional Planning Act, 1934, is a
national plan, at least potentially.
Such a plan is inevitable if one
plans at all. Without a system of
national planning there would be
reproduced a condition similar to
that which would occur if two
neighbouring estates or towns were
to plan their road systems without
reference to each other. There must
be a plan whereby such features of
national life as roads, railways,
canals, electricity, forestry, drainage,
as well as housing and building
generally, could be linked up and
co-ordinated. Perhaps, a very
important function of a national
plan would be in the direction of
population trend, a plan which would
anticipate and provide for either
shifting or stationary, localised or
widespread movements of population.
Planning seems to lead in a
logical way from house planning,
through local and regional planning
up to national planning, though
when such a system is achieved the
national plan naturally assumes the
controlling position.
The purpose of town planning is
to control the growth of towns. The
urban community is an evolutionary
growth and therefore we are dealing
with living forms. It is a growth
which the citizen directs and controls
and every feature of it is the
fruit of his design or neglect. His
control must be flexible. In town
planning legislation allowances must
be made for local conditions and
conditions of the future which are
as yet unknown. Therefore town
planning legislation cannot be cast-iron
and didactic. It is desirable,
too, that a local authority should
proceed with town planning as a
voluntary act. It is doubtful if
good results can be obtained in
cases where the chief incentive to
action is compulsion. In England
every town having a population of
20,000 or over was ordered to prepare
a town planning scheme. So
many of them failed to do so that
the order merely died and other
methods had to be employed. To
make town planning effective it
must have behind it the sympathetic
support of the authority which is to
be responsible for making and carrying
out the scheme. These facts
were recognised in drafting the Irish
Town Planning Bill.
Local Organisation.
The first step in local organisation
is to appoint a town planning
committee which should be independent
of other council committees but
should include members from committees
dealing with such matters as
housing, streets, and parks. The
local engineer might possibly be
made technical adviser to the council
on matters of town planning, but
as this gentleman usually has his
hands completely full already and,
in any case, has had no training in
planning of any sort, this suggestion
cannot be made with very great
enthusiasm. A better proposal
would be to obtain the services of a
consultant in town planning who
could, perhaps, be assisted by the
engineer in the collection of data
peculiar to local conditions. In the
misguided idea that money will be
saved thereby, some local bodies
may decide to leave the matter in
the hands of their engineer, but this
is unlikely to yield the best results,
for quite apart from the fact that
he is not equipped either by training
or experience for work of this kind,
he cannot give the necessary continuity
of supervision or detach
himself sufficiently from daily
routine to deal with the planning
of the town as a distinct operation.
He can never overcome his inability
to give this supervision, or have
this detachment, by employing a
junior assistant to relieve him of
what should be one of his most
important tasks, requiring long
experience and much skill. If he
needs assistance, as he undoubtedly
will, it should be in the form of a
consultant rather than a junior
member of his staff. Another point
is that when the employment of a
properly qualified person is contemplated
the time to call upon
him is in the earliest stage of making
preliminary surveys.
Architectural Control.
It will be recalled that portion of
the Act makes provision for control
over the design of buildings. This,
in effect, means the establishment of
a censorship for architecture. No
one will deny that censorship is good
in principle. The question is, what
form is the censorship to take?
It is difficult to be enthusiastic about
an artificially constituted censorship.
Such a system is potentially a
greater evil than those it is in tended
to counteract. The rulings of the
Church excepted, the only censorship
which has been proved to work
efficiently is that of public opinion.
Public opinion, with its great powers
for good or for evil, should be and
can be educated. This is a slow and
round-about method of establishing
a censorship, but it is infinitely
more desirable than the mere selection
of an official to pass or reject
work submitted to him. An
artificial censorship raises the initial
difficulty of deciding who is to be
the censor. How is he to be selected?
What qualifications will be deemed
necessary? What powers will he be
given?
If an artificial censorship of the
design of buildings is contemplated
the selection, qualifications and
powers of the censor need careful
consideration. As a minimum
qualification, a knowledge of the
principles of architectural design as
well as training and experience in
the planning of all types of buildings
would seem to be necessary. How
is such a censor to be obtained in
the average Irish town ? Will this
difficulty lead local bodies to force
upon their engineer the role of
Censor of Architecture, no matter
how much he may protest that.
such matters are outside his scope?
Anyone with the future of the Irish
towns and countryside at heart must
realise the necessity of some form of
architectural censorship, but if control
is to be in the hands of one
with inadequate or no qualifications
the new conditions are likely to be
worse than the old.
Town planning committees will
solve many of their greatest difficulties
by appointing at the earliest
possible stage a properly qualified
consultant in town planning. It
should be mentioned that there are,
at present, only three men in Ireland
with such qualifications. They are
Mr H T O'Rourke, Dublin City
Architect; Mr H Simms, Housing
Architect to the Dublin Corporation;
and Mr Manning D Robertson, an
architect in private practice. These
three hold the Diploma of the Town
Planning Institute. This point is
recorded in an effort to forestall all
the quack town-planners who will
inevitably appear. Ireland has
proved a happy hunting ground for
the quack architect; there is no
reason to suppose that the quack
town-planner will not be received
with open arms also. It should also
be mentioned that the writer makes
no claim to being an authority on
town planning. But he is interested
in the subject as an architect and
as a citizen.
It is, of course, true to say that
everyone is interested in town
planning, even the most irresponsible
people. It is certain, too, that
everyone agrees that town planning
is desirable. The difference between
those who town-plan, those who
read about, those who write about,
those who talk about it and those
who have heard about it are only
differences of degree. Many of
them, possibly the majority of them,
do not know that the subject they
are interested in is called town
planning. This may account for
the apathy about the Town Planning
Act. But whatever their degree
of interest they are all at one in
believing that the orderly development
which we know as town
planning is to a certain extent
necessary. How far it is necessary
depends, in part, on how sensitive
they may be to existing evils and
on how much they may know of
existing remedies. Degrees of
sensitivity will vary between consideration
for a trodden flower and
the condemnation of the other
fellow's jerry-built house. The first
is a rare quality, the last as common
as jerry-built houses. And jerry
built houses are common, so common
indeed that he who points an
indignant finger at the other fellow's
"nasty, vulgar, disgrace to the
neighbourhood, must write to the
papers about it" dwelling, has, in
all probability and quite unknown
to himself, been living in such
a house for years. Both these
extremes have one weakness in
common, a tendency towards sentimentality.
This causes those in the
first category to believe that daisies
have feelings and those in the last
to think that a fake Tudor house is
"so quaint and charming." Between
these two extremes there are
thousands of normal, healthy people
who believe in town planning
because its aim is Order and Order
is necessary in every activity, but
they hope that it will not interfere
too much with their own pleasure
or profit. Because there are such,
no town planning committee need be
without a specimen of the genus
jerry builder, who will serve his
town volubly, vehemently and entirely
disinterestedly until such time
as town planning shall appear to be
unprofitable.
But the majority of those who are
interested in town planning believe
in it because they see something
unsatisfactory in the present
growth (or decay, as the case may
be) of the Irish towns and cannot
help feeling that "something should
be done about it." What can be
done has been indicated in a very
orderly way in the provisions of the
Town Planning Act. What can be
done is also shown by the activities
of town planners in other parts of
the world.
Town Planning throughout the
World.
The most recent international survey
of the art of Town Planning is
Stadtebau und Wohnungswesen der
Welt by Bruno Schwan. Having
recovered from the initial shock of
finding that Ireland does not exist
as a town-planning country, one can
read its concisely-worded and well-laid-
out pages possibly with pleasure
and certainly with profit. It is
difficult, however, to survive the
bitter discovery that an international
survey of town planning deals with
lesser countries like Palestine, Latvia
and the Dutch East Indies (as well
as the USSR, which is not to be
mentioned at all in the best circles)
and find that Ireland is not even
given a single paragraph. But for
this omission, Herr Schwan's book
gives in a nutshell an account of all
that has been done in the domain of
town planning during recent years.
It is possible that what has been
done in this country is too recent
to have attracted his attention.
The chapter on England and Wales
records that Letchworth, the first
garden city, was begun in 1903 and
now has 4,056 houses, 66 factories,
51 workshops and 15,500 inhabitants.
Welwyn, begun in 1919, now
has 2,684 houses, 64 industries and
9,036 inhabitants. The form of
site planning practised at the first
garden city has been widely copied,
particularly in garden suburbs such
as Hampstead and in the housing
schemes of local authorities and of
public utility societies. An example
of thorough-going slum clearance was
the Kingsway, London, scheme.
Between 1900 and 1930 a street
100 feet wide (with underground
tramway) has been constructed and
the area has been changed from
slums to an important business
street. By reason of the increased
value of the sites facing the new
street this scheme has paid for
itself. It involved the acquisition
of:
an electric generating station,
four theatres,
two places of worship,
an inn of court,
a public elementary school,
a casual ward and
twenty-two public houses.
It involved also the displacement
of 7,000 persons of the working
class, for whom accommodation had
to be found elsewhere.
A new development in Germany
is the auxiliary employment settlement,
which by its position on the
outskirts of the town enables the
worker to obtain part of his income
on his settling-plot. The inclination
of the townspeople to move in to the
country is further facilitated by the
clearance of old unhealthy and
traffic-impending blocks and resettling
the inhabitants of the densely
populated quarters. This introduces
the subject of housing with which
it is at present impossible to deal in
even a scanty fashion, since it involves
so many difficult problems of
a sociological and economic nature.
Probably Germany offers the best
example of architectural control by
states and municipalities. It is
acknowledged, however, that more
is accomplished in improving architecture
and promoting orderly
development by education and by
persuasion than by the strong arm
of the law. A model building ordinance
was issued by the Ministry
of Welfare in 1919 and has been
adopted, with slight modifications,
by a large number of towns. The
following clauses relate to the
external form of buildings.
"The outward form of any construction
must be so designed in
regard to the nature of the building,
the material, the form and the
colour, that it shall not disturb the
harmonious character of the street
picture. In particular, roofs that
are out of harmony with the rest of
the street picture, in colour, design,
or material shall not be allowed.
 "In the erection of any building
consideration is to be given to the
protection from disfigurement of
natural or historical monuments and
regard must also be given to local
tradition.
"Any wall that abuts upon a
street, place or other area open to
public traffic, especially railways and
quays, must be continuously kept in
good condition."  
Berlin has a bye-law against disfigurement
of buildings. Disfigurement
is deemed to have taken place
where there is a lack of artistic
appearance and proportions in the
structure. " Artistic appearance "
is a debatable term, but there is a
Higher Council of Experts, consisting
of leading authorities and
representatives of arts and sciences
in the city, which is presided over
by the City Planning and Building
Architect.
In Saxony the police authorities
have power to prevent a display of
advertisements and to interfere in all
cases of disfigurement.
Leipzig has the following interesting
item in its bye-laws relating to
construction.
  "The back elevation of buildings
that have their fronts on the streets
are to be treated architecturally in
the same way as the elevations
facing the street. The special
approval of the building police
authorities is required for these
elevations."  
Dr Heiligenthal of Berlin summarises
his views on Architectural
Control as follows:
  "1. Architectural control should
always be in the hands of an architect
with high artistic qualifications,
recognised by the whole body of
private architects and possessing
great tact in dealing with those who
wish to build. He should also be
fully informed as to the views of the
town-planning department where the
lay-out plans are prepared; the best
arrangement of all is that where the
chief of the town planning department
is himself in a position to
exercise the function of architectural
control.
"2. The most determined opponents
of architectural control everywhere
are those architects and contractors
who have had little or no
artistic training. On the other hand
competent and qualified private
architects welcome and support
architectural control because their
own efforts to combat disfigurement
by bad neighbouring buildings are
upheld.
"3. The committees
of experts, generally
speaking, have not
fulfilled the expectations
of those who
recommended them.
It seems necessary,
if their work is to be
successful, that they
should not contain
too many members.
"4. Better and
more beneficial than
any legislative
measure, organisation of authorities
or committees
of experts is the influence of a sound
building tradition and a body of
architects united in their artistic
aims. Even in architecture good
traditions and customs are better
than strong laws."
There would appear, then, to be
several types of architectural
control. First, and most desirable,
is control by an educated public.
This is the best form because it is
the strongest and most lasting in
results. It is also the most economical.
For it is all very well to
demolish bad buildings and reject
unsuitable plans, but so much of
this, what might be called, negative
activity could be saved if, in the
first instance, building owners consulted
good architects and worked
with them in conformity with the
principles of good citizenship. The
present position in this country is
that most building owners do not
consult architects at all. Under the
best circumstances, they can be
expected to rely upon the help of a
civil engineer. Most of the housing
work carried out by local authorities,
is done under the supervision of
 Houses recently built  
engineers and the wonder is, not
that such work is often so bad, but
that it is not a great deal worse.
For housing is something for which
the average engineer has neither
aptitude nor training. Whatever he
learns about it he learns "in the
hard school of experience." In other
words, he learns entirely at his
client's expense.
The foregoing is not to be construed
as an attack upon the status
of the engineer. Nor is it in tended
to raise any controversy on the
relative importance of the two
professions. Architecture and
engineering are neither equal nor
unequal. They are just different.
It is disagreeable to introduce this
matter at all, especially since so
many engineers depend to a large
extent on housing work for a living.
It affects the present subject, however,
by showing how little the
average man cares as to who designs
his house. His indifference reaps its
own reward, as a walk through any
Irish town will show. It is not out of
place to add that if engineers wish
to do housing work with any degree
of efficiency they perhaps ought not
to rest content with their three-year
university course but should continue
through the five-year course of an
architect and become qualified as
such.
The second form of control is
secured by the appointment of an
official Censor of Architecture. This,
as has been seen, is largely practised
in Germany. It is also to be found
in Sweden and Holland, and in a
truncated form in the city of Dublin,
where the City Architect exercises
to the best of his ability and within
his limited powers, a valuable
steadying effect on the more irresponsible
members of the building
public. The "street picture"
formed on the Gresham Hotel side
of Upper O'Connell Street is largely
due to him. Somebody has said
that what is wrong with O'Connell
Street is that there is too much
architecture in it. This could,
indeed, be said of the lower portion,
though perhaps it might be more
correct to say that there is too
much of the trappings of architecture
and a total absence of architecture
itself. A jumble of competing
facades, each covered with columns,
swags and the rest of the architectural
bag of tricks, cannot fairly
be described as true architecture.
Upper O'Connell Street has been
rebuilt with greater foresight and
under a guiding hand, so that it
may be considered a success, if
judged by the standards of yesterday.
Judged by the standards of
to-day, its superficiality is a little
distressing. It is, however, an
attempt and while attempts are so
few each one of them should be
viewed with the greatest respect.
There is, besides, a form of control,
which might be described as semi-official
control, which is provided
by advisory boards of experts.
Munich, for example, has no architectural
authority, but well known
architects are consulted in cases
of need.
Signposts.
The Town Planning Committee to
which is left the problem whether
to call in a consultant or to muddle
through without one, will it is to be
hoped have adopted the much
wiser course. Otherwise, this
article will have to cover things
like Surveys and Advisory Plans,
Boundaries, Preliminary Statements
"Upper O'Connell Street has been rebuilt with... foresight."  
Draft Schemes, Zoning and Compensation
which can quite safely be
left to the town planning consultant
to introduce and elucidate. And
there really is not space here.
So this contribution will be concluded by two descriptions, one of
an Irish town five years ago and
another of the same town to-day.
If this were a play the plot would
here be neatly tidied up, the heroine
married to the hero, the heroine's
hard-hearted father paired off with
the housekeeper and the villain
suitably punished. But the writer
feels that to give a clear account of
the history of town planning and
the provisions of our Town Planning
Act and to show how important the
subject is to us in Ireland is a task
beyond his powers, so he must
despair altogether of concluding it
without leaving a numb er of loose
ends hanging about. His failure will
not worry him a great deal, for he
has a strong suspicion that he is
merely the maid dusting the furniture
as the curtain rises. If the
stars would care to develop the plot,
there is vast scope in the problem
of the right use of leisure, which is not
so unconnected with town planning
as some might think, though it is a
great deal more important to us in
Ireland and a matter of much greater
urgency. A pitch-and-toss school in
an Irish village street is a sight to
drive away all thoughts of jerrybuilding
and ribbon-development
and make one pray not only for
Building and Order but for a Father
Mathew Hall in every city, town and
village in Ireland. For, what is the
good of building in bricks and mortar
if the intellect is allowed to fall in to
disorder, stagnation and decay?
Having erected this little sign-post,
it is now possible to return to the
two descriptions.
Five Years Ago.
Business was bad, according to
the people whose mission in life it is
to take sixpence over the counter
and hard back fivepence worth.
But not everyone saw the city from
the point of view of a businessman.
Some saw it as an outpost of Gaelic
culture, others as a prelude to a
fishing holiday, while to many it was
a place of traditions and history, of
romance and teeming inspiration.
To the Gaelic scholar it was a
place of pilgrimage, for here were
the last city-born Irish speakers.
Here in their little whitewashed
thatched cottages, planted at haphazard
angles with no regular roads
running to them, lived the last
members not merely of a clan but of
a kingdom, men who lived exactly
as their forefathers lived and spoke
exactly as their forefathers spoke.
The benefits of twentieth-century
civilisation hardly touched them,
certainly not its pleasures. There
was one picture-house in the town,
but only -the young girls had so far
succumbed. The older people filled
their days with fishing and minding
the children, in which last duty the
men joined with the women. The
houses in this Irish-speaking outpost
were not hygienic, that is to say,
they would hardly comply with the
Board of Health regulations, but
they were clean and well cared for
and a credit to the town. And they
were without a single touch of
snobbery.
Through the eyes of a holiday
fisherman there was not much to be
seen, but to those who do not need
a piece of string to occupy their
minds this city was a reminder of
centuries of suffering and colourful
romance. For, by these grey rocks
and into the teeth of bitter west
winds fled the refugees from Cromwell.
Came, too, the gallions of
Spain, capping the horizon where the
Atlantic liners lie to-day.
From the harbour the islanders are
departing. An old woman with her
eyes red with weeping is staggering
up the gangway. She is followed by
a tall hawk-faced islandman wearing
a new pair of uncomfortable-looking
boots and carrying under his arm a
large ball of twine, and his cow-hide
shoes which he will change into at
the earliest opportunity. A journey
to islands almost within sight may
not appear to be good reason for
crying, but it is sufficient to separate
her for years from her children in the
city, for the fare is the whole of ten
shillings.
As the ancient steamboat swings
out from the quay-side and ploughs
outwards to the sea one does not
think of its clumsy lines or small
grubby deck or of the unsteady
chug of its engine. One thinks of it
as a link with the outer outposts of
Gaelic Ireland. When it begins to
lose shape in the distance the eye
strays from it to the grey-green
mountains on the south and the blue
mountains on the north and back
through the bottle-green of treeclumps
and the purple of nearby
church-spires. Just to the right is
a rectangular block, a seminary for
priests, a monument to the virility
of its architect. Nearer are the
grey plastered, bay-windowed suburban
houses. Nearer still, and
between these and the fishermen's
houses, appear the first symptoms
of disease- a line of red-tiled roofs,
an abomination amongst the grey,
which make no pretence to being
neighbourly or gentlemanly. For
these tiles cover the new Irishman
and his wife, especially his wife.
But, to rest the eye, there are the
fishermen's houses and the harbours
and the tall warehouses and the
tracery of rigging. Around to the
right the ramifications of the streets
lead in the direction of an old
castle of which stories are told.
It is now occupied by a bank, but
the dignity of its proportions and
the beauties of its carved panels
have been left untouched. It still
remains a monument to medieval
craftsmanship. Them is, too, a
church in which Columbus may have
prayed, for it is said that the
discoverer of the West Indies knew
this city. If beauty is something
which raises one above the everyday
world, this church is beautiful. And
when the visitor comes out again
into the sun he is not thrown with
violence into the ugliness of mundane
things but is shown a group of
countrywomen weighing chickens by
hand and making bargains in Irish
and thereby led gently back to the
acceptance of a broken line of little
straggling shops, selling boots and
red flannel and postcards and petrol
and beer.
Passing down the street one eventually
returns by circuitous routes
to the quays and the harbour. It
is inevitable that one should, for
here is the true heart of the town.
Even here in the Irish-speaking
quarter, however, one notices that
the rot has already set in, for   "many
of the lovely white houses have been
pulled down and in their place have
come the most hideous little modern
houses I have seen- worse and more
hateful to the eye than the atrocious
bungalows of Sussex."   (H V
Morton, In Search of Ireland).
A painter is sketching a group of
thatched cottages. A boy in bare
feet comes out of one of them and,
overcome by curiosity, looks over
the painter's shoulder. The boy is
asked if he speaks Irish. And what
he replies is not merely a reply, but
a portent.
For he says, "I do.
But Irish is a cod of a
language."
To-day.
"...and in their place have come.."  
The people here are
reputed to pay their
debts quicker than in
any other city in Ireland.
Business, it appears,
is brisk. The
haphazard shops are
now being fitted with
" modern " fronts,
which for the most
part are large expanses
of shine and glare,
but one notices a few
which are very quiet
and dignified. Another
cinema has been erected,
a hideous white. thing
which rudely shoulders
the ruins of an old
castle beside it. "Out
of the way, you old
dodderer," it bawls.
"Make way for
Progress in the 'ultramodemistic
style.' " An
old woman going to the
chicken-market strikes
the new keynote .
" Beidh morán airgid
ann," she says.
The streets in holiday-time are
now filled with knees; fat knees and
thin knees, hairy knees and knobby
knees, all sorts of knees in fact, for
the hiker has come to town. He may
be on his way to learn Irish in the
outer outposts, or perhaps only
coming from the Amusement Park.
For, the town now has an Amusement
Park. It used to be an enclosed
green square for quiet and repose,
but now it is let out to the roundabouts
and the swings. The park is
approached through an old stone
gateway which was brought from
somewhere and erected here so that
it could be properly cared for. But
the gateway is crumbling away.
Through the gateway one sees a new
statue in limestone. It is to honour
a Gaelic scholar. A strange little
hunched-up figure, which maybe
looks so sad because of the jazz
music on amplifiers which blares
about its ears. This square is in
front of the railway station and the
striped awnings, the trampled grass
and the bot dance music, with the
Gaelic scholar in the middle of it
all, are the visitor's first and last
 Tighthe Nua  
impressions of the town.
Soon the thatched cottages will
be no longer seen. If they have to
be removed in the interests of
hygiene, need they be replaced by
such hideous substitutes ? But
this is only a minor tragedy amidst
so much ugliness. The town has
expanded. There has, evidently,
been a spate of building during the
last five years. But when one sees
the suburbs one realises that the
proper word is "orgy." Here is
building gone mad, pretentiousness
supreme, vulgarity rampant. Nowhere
in the whole length and
breadth of Ireland can there be
more horrible houses. One looks in
vain for a dwelling with any saying
graces. This one or that one, perhaps,
may have been designed by a
gentleman. But, one feels, he was
a foolish gentleman. The longer one
gazes at all these monstrosities, the
more there grows upon one a great
feeling of hopelessness. There is nothing, nothing whatever, so
horrible, so stupid, so utterly tragic
as the mess that this City has made
of its suburbs within five short years.
And, horrified, one returns to the
railway station. In the Amusement
Park an amplifier sends out "You're
my boopadoop, hotcha-hotcha
baby" - and the little stone Gaelic
scholar looks sadder than ever.
